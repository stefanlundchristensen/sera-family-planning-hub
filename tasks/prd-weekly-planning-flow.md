# Weekly Planning Flow PRD

## Introduction/Overview

This feature introduces a structured weekly planning flow to the app, guiding families—primarily parents—through a consistent, efficient, and effective process for organizing the upcoming week. The goal is to ensure all key changes, recurring events, responsibilities, and conflicts are addressed, resulting in a finalized schedule that is clear to all family members.

## Goals

- Provide a guided, repeatable process for weekly family planning
- Ensure all schedule changes and recurring events are captured
- Make responsibility assignments explicit and modifiable
- Surface and resolve conflicts before the week begins
- Sync the finalized plan with external calendars and notify all family members

## User Stories

- As a parent, I want to be guided through a weekly planning session so that I don't miss any important changes or responsibilities.
- As a parent, I want to see all recurring events auto-populated so I don't have to enter them manually each week.
- As a parent, I want to review and adjust who is responsible for each task or event so that the workload is balanced.
- As a parent, I want to be alerted to any conflicts in the schedule so I can resolve them before the week starts.
- As a parent, I want the finalized plan to be visible to all family members and synced to our external calendars.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must allow users to input key schedule changes for the upcoming week (e.g., parent traveling, extra rehearsals).
2. The system must auto-populate the plan with recurring events (e.g., school runs, meal duties, household chores).
3. The system must allow users to review and modify responsibility assignments for each event or task.
4. The system must highlight scheduling conflicts and suggest alternative assignments or resolutions.
5. The system must provide a way to finalize the weekly plan, sync changes to connected external calendars, and notify all family members.
6. The weekly planning flow must be accessible from the sidebar and have a dedicated page to trigger and complete the flow.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The feature will not support non-family users or guests.
- The feature will not provide AI-driven suggestions for new events (only for conflict resolution).
- The feature will not allow editing of past weeks' plans.

## Design Considerations

- The entry point for the weekly planning flow should appear in the app sidebar.
- The flow should be presented as a step-by-step process on a dedicated page.
- UI should be consistent with the app's Nordic-inspired, calm, and minimal design principles.
- Use clear progress indicators and actionable buttons for each step.

## Technical Considerations

- Should integrate with the existing event and calendar modules.
- Must support syncing with external calendar providers (e.g., Google Calendar, iCal) if connected.
- Should leverage existing notification infrastructure for family updates.
- Ensure data validation for event times, assignments, and external sync.

## Success Metrics

- At least 80% of active families use the weekly planning flow at least once per month.
- Reduction in missed or conflicting events as measured by user feedback or support tickets.
- Positive feedback from parents on the clarity and ease of the planning process.

## Open Questions

- Should children or extended family have view-only access to the planning flow, or be able to suggest changes?
- What is the ideal time in the week to prompt parents to start the planning flow?
- Should the flow support saving drafts before finalization?
