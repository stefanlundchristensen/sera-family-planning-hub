# Supabase Integration Preparation Plan

This document outlines the steps to prepare our application before integrating with Supabase.

## Prerequisites to Complete

1. **Local/Mock Data Structure**
   - [x] Set up local state management with Zustand
   - [x] Implement mock data and event creation utilities
   - [x] Ensure all components can work with local data before moving to remote data

2. **State Management**
   - [x] Set up Zustand store structure
   - [x] Implement optimistic updates in state modifications
   - [x] Add error handling and state reversal on failed operations
   - [ ] Review store structure to ensure it matches intended backend data model

3. **Type Definitions**
   - [x] Define core types for events and family members
   - [ ] Ensure consistent type usage across the application
   - [ ] Add validation for data structures
   - [ ] Consider adding Zod schemas for runtime validation

4. **UI Loading & Error States**
   - [ ] Add proper loading indicators for async operations
   - [ ] Implement consistent error handling UI
   - [ ] Add toast notifications for operation success/failure
   - [ ] Ensure all forms handle submission states properly

5. **API Client Layer**
   - [x] Set up initial API client structure
   - [x] Implement caching mechanism
   - [ ] Add request/response interceptors
   - [ ] Ensure consistent error handling

6. **Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] Plan user authentication flow
   - [ ] Define required user profile information
   - [ ] Set up protected routes
   - [ ] Implement login/registration forms

## Next Steps for Supabase Integration

Once the above prerequisites are met:

1. Connect the Lovable project to Supabase via the green Supabase button
2. Set up database tables matching our data models
3. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
4. Implement authentication with Supabase Auth
5. Update API client to use Supabase client
6. Test all CRUD operations with real database

## Notes

- Keep the frontend working with local data until Supabase integration is complete
- Consider implementing feature flags to switch between local and Supabase data
- Test thoroughly after each integration step
