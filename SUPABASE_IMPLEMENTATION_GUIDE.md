# Sera Family Planning Hub - Supabase Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Supabase into the Sera Family Planning application.

## Database Schema

### Tables and Relationships

1. **Profiles Table**
```sql
profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users,
  name text,
  email text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone
)
```

2. **Family Groups Table**
```sql
family_groups (
  id uuid primary key,
  name text,
  owner_id uuid references profiles(id),
  created_at timestamp with time zone,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone
)
```

3. **Family Memberships Table**
```sql
family_memberships (
  id uuid primary key,
  family_id uuid references family_groups(id),
  user_id uuid references profiles(id),
  role user_role,
  created_at timestamp with time zone,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone
)
```

4. **Events Table**
```sql
events (
  id uuid primary key,
  title text,
  description text,
  start_time timestamp with time zone,
  end_time timestamp with time zone,
  family_id uuid references family_groups(id),
  created_by uuid references profiles(id),
  assigned_to uuid references profiles(id),
  created_at timestamp with time zone,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone
)
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Setup (Week 1)
- [x] Create all database tables
- [x] Implement RLS policies
- [x] Set up helper functions
- [x] Test database operations

#### RLS Policies Overview
- Profiles: Only accessible by the user themselves
- Family Groups: Accessible by members
- Events: Accessible by family members
- Memberships: Accessible by family admins

### Phase 2: Authentication System (Week 1-2)
- [x] Create Auth pages (login/register)
- [x] Implement session management
- [x] Set up protected routes
- [ ] Create user onboarding flow

### Phase 3: Family System (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Family creation flow
- [ ] Membership management
- [ ] Invitation system
- [ ] Family settings UI

### Phase 4: Events System (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Migrate events to Supabase
- [ ] Implement real-time updates
- [ ] Add role-based permissions
- [ ] Update event forms

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)
- [ ] Test all user flows
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Data migration strategy
- [ ] Deployment

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Auth flows
- Permission checks
- Event operations
- Family management

### Integration Tests

## Rollout Plan

### Stage 1: Alpha Testing
- Internal testing
- Basic functionality
- Core features only

### Stage 2: Beta Testing
- Limited user group
- Feature complete
- Gathering feedback

### Stage 3: Production
- Full release
- All features enabled
- Monitoring and support

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration
