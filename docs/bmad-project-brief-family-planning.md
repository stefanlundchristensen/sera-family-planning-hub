# Project Brief: Family Planning & Calendar Integration

## Introduction / Problem Statement

Modern families—especially in Europe—spend too much time and energy trying to coordinate schedules, manage logistics, and make room for everything—often at the expense of simply being present as parents, partners, and individuals. The constant juggling of calendars, events, and responsibilities across fragmented platforms leads to stress, missed opportunities, and less quality time together. European families face additional challenges around GDPR compliance, school system integration, and diverse, multi-generational family structures that are not addressed by mainstream solutions.

By introducing a unified, privacy-first family planning and assistant solution, we aim to put the logistical side of family life on autopilot. This will empower families to focus on what truly matters: being good partners, parents, friends, and humans.

## Vision & Goals

- **Vision:** To empower families to reclaim their time and peace of mind by automating the planning and coordination of daily life—enabling them to focus on relationships, growth, and well-being, while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and data sovereignty.
- **Primary Goals:**
  1. Seamless, bi-directional synchronization with Google Calendar for all family members.
  2. Robust user and family management, including role-based access, privacy controls, and support for multi-generational coordination.
  3. Effortless onboarding for all family members, regardless of technical ability.
  4. Launch a working MVP to at least 100 families within 6 months of development start.
- **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**
  - Number of families actively using the app within 3 and 6 months.
  - Percentage of users who successfully connect and sync external calendars.
  - User satisfaction (measured via NPS or in-app feedback).
  - Reduction in reported scheduling conflicts or missed events.
  - Compliance with GDPR and user privacy expectations.

## Target Audience / Users

The primary users are modern families—parents, children, caregivers, and multi-generational households—who juggle multiple schedules, activities, and responsibilities.

- **Parents:** Often working, managing both professional and family commitments, seeking tools to reduce stress and improve coordination.
- **Children:** School-aged, with their own events and activities, requiring appropriate privacy and access controls.
- **Caregivers/Extended Family:** Grandparents or others who may need limited or special access, including older adults with accessibility needs.
- **Divorced/Co-parenting Families:** Need for neutral, privacy-respecting coordination tools.

**Key needs include:**
- A unified, easy-to-use platform for all family logistics
- Privacy-first, GDPR-compliant data handling and EU data residency
- Role-based access for sensitive information and multi-generational privacy boundaries
- Effortless onboarding for users of all ages and tech abilities
- Integration with existing calendars and, where possible, public systems (e.g., school event imports)
- Unified view across work and private calendars for each family member
- Assistance in planning via proven workflows and smart suggestions
- Simplified interfaces that maintain functionality and reduce adoption barriers
- Localization and multi-language support for European markets

## Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)

- Google Calendar sync (one-way or basic two-way)
- Create a family group (one parent, invite others)
- Add/view family events in a unified calendar
- Basic roles: Parent (full access), Child (view-only)
- Highlight event conflicts (no smart suggestions)
- Simple onboarding (email/password)
- Privacy-first architecture and clear data handling policies

## Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas

- iCalendar sync and support for additional calendar providers
- Advanced role management (e.g., multiple parents, caregivers, custom permissions, multi-generational privacy controls)
- Smart planning assistance (suggest optimal times, automated reminders, workflow templates)
- Integration with public systems (e.g., school event imports from Aula, Pronote, etc.)
- Social logins and advanced onboarding flows
- Mobile app or mobile-optimized interface
- Event categories, tags, and advanced filtering
- Family task lists, meal planning, and other assistant modules
- Analytics and insights (e.g., family activity trends, missed events)
- In-app messaging or notifications
- Court-admissible record keeping and neutral communication tools for custody coordination
- Comprehensive localization (multi-language, date/time/holiday formats)
- Healthcare scheduling integration for older adults
- One-time purchase or freemium business model options

*Note: The prioritization and design of post-MVP features will be guided by actual user feedback, interviews, and ongoing market research, especially for European requirements.*

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

- **Constraints:**
  - Prototype will be built leveraging only AI coding agents (no manual coding by the core team for MVP)
  - Initial team: 2–3 developers (AI agents), 1 marketing, founder
  - Need for rapid MVP delivery (target: 6 months)
  - Budget-conscious: prioritize open-source and cost-effective solutions
  - Must comply with GDPR, Digital Services Act, and privacy best practices, especially for children's data
  - Initial focus on Google Calendar integration only
  - Data residency within EU jurisdictions preferred

- **Initial Architectural Preferences:**
  - Build on the existing React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS stack (see README.md)
  - Use shadcn/ui components for styling
  - State management via React Hooks
  - Routing with React Router
  - Monorepo for simplicity and speed
  - Monolithic or modular monolith backend to start; microservices considered post-MVP if needed
  - Use of Supabase for authentication, user management, and database
  - Cloud hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or similar) for rapid deployment
  - CalDAV implementation for maximum interoperability
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication and comprehensive data export functionality

- **Risks:**
  - Technical complexity of reliable calendar sync and school system integration
  - Ensuring robust privacy, security, and regulatory compliance for family/child data
  - User adoption and onboarding friction, especially for older adults
  - Market acceptance and differentiation from existing solutions
  - Reliance on AI coding agents for all development may introduce unique challenges in code quality, maintainability, and iteration speed
  - Localization and multi-language support complexity
  - Regulatory risks (GDPR, Digital Services Act, country-specific child data protection ages)

- **User Preferences:**
  - Unified view across work and private calendars
  - Assistance in planning via proven workflows
  - Simple, intuitive onboarding
  - Privacy-first, transparent data practices
  - Affordable alternatives to subscription-heavy incumbents
