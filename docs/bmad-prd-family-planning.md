# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Family Planning & Calendar Integration

---

## 1. Introduction

This PRD defines the requirements for a privacy-first, GDPR-compliant family planning application focused on seamless Google Calendar integration, robust user management, and secure authentication using Supabase. The product is designed to address the unique needs of European families—including multi-generational households, school system integration, and localization—while providing a simple, unified platform for family coordination.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

European families face significant challenges in coordinating schedules due to fragmented information across multiple platforms, heightened privacy concerns, and complex family structures. Existing solutions often lack GDPR compliance, multi-generational support, and integration with local school systems. Managing user accounts and permissions within a family context requires robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure privacy, security, and data sovereignty.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Enable seamless, bi-directional synchronization between the custom calendar application and Google Calendar (with iCalendar as a post-MVP goal).
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Implement secure, privacy-first user management for multiple family members, including multi-generational households.
  - Provide role-based access control (RBAC) to manage event visibility and editing permissions.
  - Ensure secure authentication methods using Supabase, with GDPR-compliant data handling and EU data residency.
  - Support localization and multi-language needs for European markets.
  - Lay the groundwork for future school system integrations (e.g., Aula, Pronote).

## 4. User Stories

### User Story 1: Parent Creates Account for Family
- **As a:** Parent
- **I want:** To create accounts for myself and other family members (e.g., spouse, children, grandparents)
- **So that:** Each family member can access the application with their own credentials
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parents can register multiple user accounts.
- Accounts are associated with a primary "family" group.
- Family group supports multi-generational structure.

### User Story 2: Child or Grandparent Signs In to Access Personal Events
- **As a:** Child or Grandparent
- **I want:** To sign in using my own account to view and edit events relevant to me
- **So that:** I can access only the events that pertain to me, with appropriate privacy controls
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Children and grandparents can create accounts linked to their family's group.
- Upon signing in, users see a filtered list of events based on their role and privacy settings.

### User Story 3: Parent Assigns Roles and Permissions
- **As a:** Parent
- **I want:** To assign roles (e.g., Parent, Child, Grandparent) and permissions (view/edit events)
- **So that:** Family members have appropriate access levels and privacy boundaries
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parents can select roles for each family member during account creation.
- Different roles determine the level of event interaction and data visibility.

### User Story 4: Authorization Based on Role
- **As a:** User with specific role (Parent/Child/Grandparent)
- **I want:** To only view and edit events I am authorized to handle
- **So that:** Unauthorized users cannot access restricted information
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Events are marked with access levels based on user roles and privacy settings.
- Only authenticated users with the required permissions can interact with specific events.

### User Story 5: Localization and Accessibility
- **As a:** European family member
- **I want:** The app to support my language, date/time formats, and accessibility needs
- **So that:** All family members can use the app comfortably, regardless of age or tech skill
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- App supports multiple languages and regional formats.
- Accessibility features are available for older adults and users with disabilities.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### User Management
- Create tables in Supabase for `users`, `families`, and `user_roles`.
- Each family group is represented by a unique identifier linked to multiple user accounts.
- User roles include Parent, Child, Grandparent, etc., with associated permissions and privacy boundaries.
- Support for multi-generational family structures and custody coordination (post-MVP).

### Authentication
- Implement secure sign-in methods using Supabase's built-in authentication features:
  - Email/Password
  - OAuth providers (Google, Apple, Microsoft)
- Store hashed passwords securely in the database.
- Ensure GDPR-compliant data handling and EU data residency.

### Authorization
- Use RBAC to control access based on user roles and privacy settings.
- Define event-level permissions to restrict editing and viewing of events to authorized users only.
- Support for court-admissible record keeping and neutral communication tools for custody coordination (post-MVP).

### Calendar Integration
- Implement seamless, bi-directional sync with Google Calendar (MVP).
- Lay groundwork for iCalendar and CalDAV support (post-MVP).
- Provide robust API/webhook support for future school system integrations (e.g., Aula, Pronote).
- Ensure comprehensive data export functionality (GDPR Article 20 compliance).

### Localization & Accessibility
- Support multiple languages, date/time/holiday formats, and regional conventions.
- Ensure accessibility for older adults and users with disabilities.

### Privacy & Compliance
- Privacy-by-design architecture with transparent data practices.
- Data residency within EU jurisdictions preferred.
- Compliance with GDPR, Digital Services Act, and country-specific child data protection ages.
