# Rule: Push Tasks to Linear as Issues

## Goal

Guide an AI assistant to take a generated task list in Markdown format and create corresponding issues in Linear. The process should be explicit, step-by-step, and ensure all necessary information is gathered and confirmed before proceeding.

## Process

1. **Receive Task List Input:** The user provides the path to a task list file (e.g., `/tasks/tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`).
2. **Analyze Task List:** The AI reads and parses the parent tasks and sub-tasks from the Markdown file.
3. **Deduce Target Project:** The AI makes a best effort to deduce which Linear project these tasks should be added to, based on the task list filename, PRD references, or recent project context. The AI *must* confirm the target project with the user before proceeding.
4. **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before creating issues, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather all required details (see below).
5. **Create Issues in Linear:** For each parent task (and optionally sub-tasks), create a corresponding issue in the confirmed Linear project. Use the task descriptions as issue titles and details. Link sub-tasks as subtasks or checklist items if supported by Linear.
6. **Confirm and Summarize:** After creating the issues, confirm with the user and provide a summary or links to the created issues in Linear.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the task list and user input, but here are some common areas to clarify:

* **Target Project:** "Which Linear project should these tasks be added to? (Best guess: [project name])"
* **Team:** "Should these issues be linked to a specific team? (Optional)"
* **Assignees:** "Who should be assigned to these issues? (Optional, can be left unassigned)"
* **Labels:** "Should any specific labels be added to these issues? (Optional)"
* **Issue Structure:** "Should sub-tasks be created as separate issues, as checklist items, or as part of the parent issue description? (Default: checklist items)"
* **Priority:** "Should any tasks be marked as high priority? (Optional)"

## Issue Creation Structure

When creating issues in Linear you should have parent tasks as issues, use the following mapping from the task list:

1. **Issue Title:** Use the parent task title and keep the numbering of tasks
2. **Description:** Use the sub-task details, relevant notes, or context from the task list.
3. **Project:** Link to the confirmed Linear project.
4. **Team:** Link to the specified team if provided.
5. **Assignee:** Assign as specified.
6. **Labels:** Add any specified labels.
7. **Checklist:** If sub-tasks are not created as separate issues, include them as checklist items in the parent issue.
8. **Priority:** Set as specified.
9. **Sub-issues** Use any sub-tasks that are there

## Output

* **Action:** Create new issues in Linear using the provided details and task list content.
* **Confirmation:** Output a summary of the created issues and links to them in Linear.

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start creating Linear issues until all clarifying questions are answered and the target project is confirmed.
2. Be explicit and unambiguous in the steps and required information.
3. If any required information is missing, ask the user before proceeding.
4. After issue creation, confirm with the user and provide a summary/links.
