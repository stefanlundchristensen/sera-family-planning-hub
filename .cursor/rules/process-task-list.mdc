# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`. 
  2. When the task is marked completed above, please ensure that the relevant **sub-issue** in Linear (if there) is also set to be completed (Done).
  3. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed. 
  4. If a **parent task** is marked as completed, please ensure that the relevant issue in Linear is also set to be completed (Done).
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## Linear Sync & Pre-Task Checks

- **Before starting any new sub-task or parent task:**
  1. Check that the task list and Linear are in sync:
     - All completed tasks in the task list are also marked as Done in Linear (and vice versa).
     - All open tasks/sub-tasks in the task list have corresponding issues/sub-issues in Linear (if Linear is being used for this PRD).
     - If any discrepancies are found, **prompt the user to help resolve the discrepancy**. The user can either provide the answer or ask the AI to deduce the correct state from the codebase and context.
  2. If a new sub-task is started, ensure a corresponding sub-issue exists in Linear (if using sub-issues).
  3. If a new parent task is started, ensure a corresponding parent issue exists in Linear.
  4. All completions and status changes must be reflected in both the task list and Linear.

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
   - Ensure all completions and status changes are reflected in Linear as well.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next **and** ensure the task list and Linear are in sync.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
