# Rule: Push PRD to Linear as a Project

## Goal

Guide an AI assistant to take a generated Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format and create a corresponding project in Linear. The process should be explicit, step-by-step, and ensure all necessary information is gathered before proceeding.

## Process

1. **Receive PRD Input:** The user provides the path to a PRD file (e.g., `/tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`).
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before creating the Linear project, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather all required details. The goal is to ensure the project is created in the correct context and with the right metadata.
3. **Create Linear Project:** Using the answers and the PRD content, create a new project in Linear, populating the project fields as specifically as possible.
4. **Confirm and Save:** Confirm the project creation with the user and provide a summary or link to the new Linear project.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the PRD and user input, but here are some common areas to clarify:

* **Team:** "Which Linear team should this project be linked to? (Please provide the team name or ID)"
* **Project Name:** "What should the project be called in Linear? (Default: PRD title)"
* **Project Summary:** "Provide a short summary for the Linear project (1-2 sentences). (Default: PRD overview/introduction)"
* **Target Date:** "Is there a target completion date for this project? (Optional)"
* **Labels:** "Should any specific labels be added to the project? (Optional)"
* **Assignees:** "Who should be assigned as the project lead or owner? (Optional)"
* **Visibility:** "Should the project be public or private in Linear? (Default: private)"

## Linear Project Structure

When creating the Linear project, use the following mapping from the PRD:

1. **Project Name:** Use the PRD title or a user-specified name.
2. **Summary:** Use the PRD introduction/overview or a user-specified summary.
3. **Description:** Attach the full PRD content as the project description in Markdown.
4. **Team:** Use the specified Linear team.
5. **Target Date:** Set if provided.
6. **Labels:** Add any specified labels.
7. **Assignees:** Assign project lead/owner if specified.
8. **Visibility:** Set as public or private as specified.

## Output

* **Action:** Create a new project in Linear using the provided details and PRD content.
* **Confirmation:** Output a summary of the created project and a link to it in Linear.

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start creating the Linear project until all clarifying questions are answered.
2. Do NOT start doing any implementations of the PRd
2. Be explicit and unambiguous in the steps and required information.
3. If any required information is missing, ask the user before proceeding.
4. After project creation, confirm with the user and provide a summary/link.
