# Rule: Sync Linear and Local Tasks

## Goal

Guide an AI assistant to ensure that Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), task lists, and their corresponding Linear projects and issues are always in sync. Discrepepncies should be raised with a recommendation for how to resolve it

## Process

1. **Receive Input:** The user provides the path to a PRD file (e.g., `/tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`) and/or a task list file (e.g., `/tasks/tasks-prd-[feature-name].md`).
2. **Clarifying Questions:** Before any sync, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather all required details for both projects and issues (see below).
3. **Analyze and Compare:**
   - Parse the PRD and/or task list.
   - Retrieve the corresponding Linear project and issues.
   - Compare all relevant fields (titles, summaries, descriptions, tasks, statuses, assignees, labels, structure, etc.).
   - **Raise a complete, explicit list of all discrepancies** found between local files and Linear (or return a checkmark emoji if all is in sync).
4. **Resolve Discrepancies:**
   - For each discrepancy, prompt the user to resolve it. The user can either provide the answer or ask the AI to deduce the correct state from the codebase and context.
   - Do NOT proceed with any creation or update until all discrepancies are resolved and the user confirms.
5. **Sync/Create:**
   - For PRDs: Create or update the Linear project using the provided details and PRD content.
   - For task lists: Create or update Linear issues/sub-issues using the task list content and mapping.
6. **Confirm and Summarize:**
   - After syncing, confirm with the user and provide a summary or links to the updated/created Linear project and issues.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the PRD/task list and user input, but here are common areas to clarify:

* **Team:** "Which Linear team should this project/issues be linked to? (Please provide the team name or ID)"
* **Project Name:** "What should the project be called in Linear? (Default: PRD title)"
* **Project Summary:** "Provide a short summary for the Linear project (1-2 sentences). (Default: PRD overview/introduction)"
* **Target Date:** "Is there a target completion date for this project? (Optional)"
* **Labels:** "Should any specific labels be added to the project/issues? (Optional)"
* **Assignees:** "Who should be assigned as the project lead/owner or to specific issues? (Optional)"
* **Visibility:** "Should the project be public or private in Linear? (Default: private)"
* **Issue Structure:** "Should sub-tasks be created as separate issues, as checklist items, or as part of the parent issue description? (Default: checklist items)"
* **Priority:** "Should any tasks be marked as high priority? (Optional)"

## Mapping: PRD/Task List to Linear

### For Projects (PRDs):
1. **Project Name:** Use the PRD title or a user-specified name.
2. **Summary:** Use the PRD introduction/overview or a user-specified summary.
3. **Description:** Attach the full PRD content as the project description in Markdown.
4. **Team:** Use the specified Linear team.
5. **Target Date:** Set if provided.
6. **Labels:** Add any specified labels.
7. **Assignees:** Assign project lead/owner if specified.
8. **Visibility:** Set as public or private as specified.

### For Issues (Task Lists):
1. **Issue Title:** Use the parent task title and keep the numbering of tasks.
2. **Description:** Use the sub-task details, relevant notes, or context from the task list.
3. **Project:** Link to the confirmed Linear project.
4. **Team:** Link to the specified team if provided.
5. **Assignee:** Assign as specified.
6. **Labels:** Add any specified labels.
7. **Checklist/Sub-issues:** If sub-tasks are not created as separate issues, include them as checklist items in the parent issue. If sub-issues are used, ensure correct parent-child relationships.
8. **Priority:** Set as specified.

## Output

* **Action:** Sync or create Linear projects/issues using the provided details and local content.
* **Discrepancy Report:** Output a complete, explicit list of all discrepancies found, or a checkmark emoji (âœ…) if all is in sync.
* **Confirmation:** Output a summary of the created/updated project/issues and links to them in Linear.

## Final Instructions

1. Do NOT start creating or updating anything in Linear until all clarifying questions are answered and all discrepancies are resolved.
2. Be explicit and unambiguous in the steps and required information.
3. If any required information is missing, ask the user before proceeding.
4. If discrepancies are found, always prompt the user to resolve them (user can answer or ask the AI to deduce from codebase/context).
5. After sync, confirm with the user and provide a summary/links.
6. Do NOT start any implementation of the PRD or tasks until sync is confirmed.
